 Compile Instructions

Required:
- CDMS source (CDMS_src.zip)
- Rainman source (Rainman_src.zip)
- wxWidgets 2.8.0 (http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxwindows/wxWidgets-2.8.0.zip?modtime=1165916197)
- LUA 5.0.2 (http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.0.2.tar.gz)
- LUA 5.1.2 (http://www.lua.org/ftp/lua-5.1.2.tar.gz)
- zLib (included in Rainman_src.zip)
- wxPropgrid 1.2.6 (http://downloads.sourceforge.net/wxpropgrid/wxpropgrid-1.2.6-src.tar.gz?modtime=1169386064)
- wxPropgrid hack (wxPropgrid-modifications.zip)
- LUA hack (lua502-src_mod.zip)

Instructions:

* Build wxWidgets from the solution file in the wxWidgets/Build directory.
	Use the batch build tool to build only the
	'Debug', 'Release', 'Unicode Debug' and 'Unicode Release' configurations

* Install wxPropgrid to the wxWidgets/contrib directory
	Install the wxPropgrid hack (header files in wxWidgets/contrib/include/wx/propgrid)
	source files in wxWidgets/contrib/src/propgrid)

* Build wxPropgrid with the same configurations as you did for wxWidgets
	(Solution file is in wxWidgets/contrib/build/propgrid)

* Build wxStc with the same configurations as you did for wxWidgets
	(Solution file is in wxWidgets/contrib/build/stc)

* Build LUA 5.0.2
	Install the hack to the LUA/src directory.
	(Instructions for building are in the LUA/Install file)

* Build LUA 5.1.2
	(Instructions for building are in the LUA/Install file)

* Build Rainman
	Add all the .cpp , .c and .h files in the main folder and the zLib folder to a project
	(do not add the ones in \include)
	Set the project to compile as a Dynamically Linked Library (DLL)
	Add the rainman\include directory to your compiler's include directory list
	Add the LUA\include directory to your compiler's include directory list
	Add wherever you have built the LUA libraries to the compilers additional library directories
	Add 'lua-5.0.2.lib lua-5.0.2-std.lib shlwapi.lib' to the compilers additional librarys
	Compile away

* Build CDMS
	Add all the .cpp , .c and .h files in the main folder
	Set the project to compile as a Executable (EXE)
	Add wxWidgets/include wxWidgets/lib/vc_lib/, wxWidgets/contrib/include, Rainman/src/include and wxWidgets/lib/vc_lib/msw to your compiler's include directory list
	Add wxWidgets/lib, wxWidgets/lib/vc_lib, Rainman/libs, wxWidgets/lib/vc_dll, wxWidgets/contrib/lib and wherever you have built the LUA libraries
	Add 'Rainman.lib wxmsw28u_stc.lib wxmsw28u_adv.lib wxmsw28u_aui.lib wxmsw28u_html.lib wxbase28u_xml.lib wxmsw28u_xrc.lib wxmsw28u_propgrid.lib wxmsw28u_core.lib wxbase28u.lib wxtiff.lib wxjpeg.lib wxpng.lib wxzlib.lib wxregexu.lib wxexpat.lib winmm.lib comctl32.lib rpcrt4.lib wsock32.lib oleacc.lib odbc32.lib lua-5.0.2.lib and lua-5.0.2-std.lib'
	to the compilers additional librarys
	Compile

NB: Depending on which compiler you use, you may need to adjust some of the source files so it compiles.
    EG: Adding int datatypes to constants (supported by VS2003 but not VS2005) or typecasting char* to const char* etc.
